				<h1>No homework today</h1>
				<p>
					I don't know what happened today but I experienced something new. It was a bad, dark feeling in the pit of my stomach and usually that wouldn't bother me because I like that stuff. It's the stuff I was born out of but today was different. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					After some research on the computer, I have come to the conclusion that it was pity that I was experiencing. And if
					that wasn't strange enough, I was feeling sorry for my owner. She was completely ignoring me as she does quite often
					nowdays (but I have no idea why, it's not like I'm a psycho or anything) and she looked like she was doing actual work. As in proper school work. Strange right? She's always been slack about it but today was different.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					After what seemed like hours, I finally took the initiative to force her to stop and take a break. Honestly, I don't think I've ever met anyone or anything that was so unaware of their own health that they couldn't recognise 
					exhaustion even when it hit them in the face.
